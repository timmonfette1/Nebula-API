Nebula API
===================

Description
------------
Nebula is a Holographic Shopping App for the Microsoft Hololens.

It is a project done as part of my Capstone Project at Drexel University.

This is a copy of the Nebula Backend System and REST API that I have written for the Project.

It is currently written in Golang. I will update this with all major releases of the backend system code, it will not be up to date on minor releases.

(Due to a laptop dying and other issues, I missed a few commits for versions 2.0 and 2.1).

Current version in repository: 2.3


Final Release Notes
------------
These Release Notes will cover all of the major changes in the final version of the Nebula Backend System.

* Inclusion of the DBMaintain utility for setting up the Testing Databases for Regression Testing the API.
* Inculsion of the API Regression testing suite.  Contains a suite of Python tests that run on the API (preferably a dev version).
* Refactored API code to have a more modular file/code structure.
* Addition of many new endpoints to the REST API.
* No more development will continue on the API since the project is now concluded.

Development will only re-open if years in the future the Microsoft HoloLens becomes more widely available and this group wishes to captialize on the market for it.


Versions
------------
Version 1.9: First version uploaded here. Contains code written over ~6 months.

Version 2.3: Final version from the project. See final release notes for what was changed.
